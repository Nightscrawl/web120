    <h2>Responsive vs. Mobile</h2>

    <p>
        As of December 2019, worldwide mobile market share is 53.29%; if tablets are included as a mobile device, the share is 56.01% (StatCounter).

    <p>
        The future is mobile. A web developer who fails to heed these growing statistics is doing a disservice to her clients and to herself. The intentionality to design a site that has built-in flexibility, with the ability to display and function on a range of devices, will ensure maximum reach for any person, business, or organization.
    </p>

    <p>
        With the benefit of mobile design established, the question then becomes whether to create a responsive mobile <em>website</em> or a full-featured mobile <em>application</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Responsive design is standard web design and coding, using the known big three: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This approach tailors the website appearance to the experience of browsing on a desktop or mobile device, typically by changing the layout, as well as possibly adding or removing content. It is “responsive” because it dynamically responds to the size of the screen on the user’s device.
    </p>

    <p>
        A mobile application is a separate application that is not viewed within the browser. These “are specific applications customized to each Operating System (OS) that feature unique designs and codebases” (Kris). The application is specifically designed for the mobile experience; it will not be used on the desktop. The browser version of the site, while perhaps also responsive, will be different from the mobile application in design and use.
    </p>

    <p>
        A traditional website that is responsive can be made by a developer with a more limited skillset, within a shorter time span, resulting in reduced expenditure for the client (Kris). A mobile application needs a developer with more advanced skills who is familiar with iOS or Android coding – ideally both for greater reach, resulting in higher costs and greater time to live deployment (Kris). 
    </p>

    <p>
        As with many things, the answer to the question is, “It depends.” It is imperative that the developer work with her client to gain a thorough understanding of the client’s needs, goals, and resources. 
    </p>

    <p>
        A client may not <em>need</em> a full-featured mobile application, particularly if their web presence is purely informational. This applies to businesses that are both small and large, as well as individuals and groups. Neither <a href="https://getyourhotcakes.com/" target="_blank">Hot Cakes</a>, a small business, or <a href="https://www.mms.com/en-us/" target="_blank">M&Ms</a>, a large brand, need a mobile application; nor do the author <a href="https://stephenking.com/" target="_blank">Stephen King</a> or the rock group <a href="https://www.aspswelten.de/" target="_blank">ASP</a> need a mobile application – a responsive website will satisfy all of their needs in reaching current and potential consumers and fans.
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition, client goals and resources are also a concern. In December 2018, the blogging platform <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>, which does have a <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/apps" target="_blank">mobile application</a> that works alongside its browser experience, suffered an exodus of users in response to new restrictive content policies (Wikipedia). Some of those users migrated to smaller, less restrictive, and lesser known blogging platforms. Consider the situation of such a lesser known platform: a smaller company with limited resources, wanting to build up its userbase. Perhaps when the platform was created, the goal was to focus on the web presence <em>first</em>, build up a userbase, and then, with a larger audience and more resources, invest in a mobile application. A web developer should not push such a client toward the development of a mobile application if it does not meet their current needs, extends too far beyond their current plans, or exceeds their current capabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
        On the other hand, businesses who need or want access to mobile device features such as the camera (for both picture-taking as well as scanning QR or bar codes), GPS location information, or touch screen capability, will likely want and need a mobile application as their primary platform for user interaction. The fitness tracker app, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.runtastic.android&hl=en_US" target="_blank">Runtastic</a>, takes advantage of several mobile device features: it prompts the user to take a photo after a workout, uses GPS location to track the path of running and gauge distance, and even enables connection to other devices, like wearable heart rate monitors. In contrast, <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/" target="_blank">Runtastic’s website</a> exists primarily as a web space for the company’s fitness blog and a repository from which users can download their information (a feature since retired).
    </p>

    <p>
        The situation may arise where a client will want both a traditional website and a full-featured mobile application. It is necessary for the developer to keep <em>usability</em> at the forefront of design: <em>Who</em> is the audience? <em>Why</em> are they using (the app/the website)? The answers will help to determine whether the design of both experiences should allow for the same level of interactivity, or whether one should complement the other, as with Runtastic. Poor planning can lead to negative user experience. The digital learning platform, Canvas, has both a <a href="https://www.instructure.com/canvas/" target="_blank">website</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instructure.candroid&hl=en_US" target="_blank">mobile application</a>. While the website allows for much interactivity, including test-taking, assignment submission, class discussion, and detailed lesson plans, the mobile application is more limited; its primary utility is to check grades, use the calendar to view assignment deadlines, and check the inbox; it is also considerably slower than the web version, with more cumbersome navigation. This places students who have limited web access, who might primarily use their phone while away from school, at a considerable disadvantage (Newman).

    <p>
        In 2018, 98% of China’s 800 million internet users accessed the web through a mobile device (McCarthy). The past few years have seen the implementation of HTML5, CSS3, and continual iterations of JavaScript’s standards, ECMAScript. Manipulation of CSS flexible containers and use of frameworks like Bootstrap are effective and powerful tools for creating responsive websites that will render and perform well at any size. As of January 2020, there were over 5.5 million mobile applications available in the four major app stores (Statista). A web developer who chooses to ignore these changes and trends is a poor web developer, literally and figuratively.
