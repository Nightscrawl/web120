    Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. I'll be sure to note that in my log. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Your shields were failing, sir. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! I'll alert the crew. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. This should be interesting. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir.

    We have a saboteur aboard. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. I am your worst nightmare! You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. I will obey your orders.

    I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. They were just sucked into space. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data.

    I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. Well, that's certainly good to know. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise.
