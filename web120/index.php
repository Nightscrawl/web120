<h2>Hello!</h2>

<p>
    I've traveled over four-thousand miles to get to where I am. Born and raised in Miami, Florida, eleven years ago, I undertook a two-month car journey to Seattle, Washington, taking in the various sights and sites along the way. To this day, it remains my greatest adventure.
</p>

<p>
    Now, I'm on a different sort of journey, one of self-improvement as I pursue a degree in the field of web development. I have an interest in working with non-profit, philanthropic, charitable organizations, which is what I am ultimately hoping to do with my degree and the skills I develop while working toward it. In the 21st century, it is important for organizations of all sorts to have a viable web presence; this is not limited only to for-profit businesses; non-profits need to have it as well in order to spread awareness of their cause, maximize reach, and obtain the donations they need to continue their good and important work.

    On a more casual note, while my played library isn't very extensive, I consider myself to be a gamer. I used to be an active player of <i>World of Warcraft</i>, which I played for about ten years. In addition, I was an officer in a few different guilds, as well as a raid leader. Helping to organize a bunch of people (up to 25!) is no easy task! While I've been out of that scene for a few years, I'm hoping that experience will serve me well in the years to come.
</p>

<p>
    My primary game genre is singleplayer RPG, and more specifically Dragon Age and <i>Skyrim</i>. I am an avid mod user and creator for both games. I also write a bit of fanfic concerning my character from <i>Dragon Age: Inquisition</i>.

    Finally, I try to maintain my fitness through running, both indoors and out, when the weather permits. Flying down Seattle's hills is exhilarating until you have to go back up again!
